# OCCURRENCES PROBLEM
Write down a computer solution that can be used to count the number of times a particular digit appears in an (integer) input. Hint you may assume that there is an operator % that returns the remainder when one integer is divided by another and has the syntax a %b where a and b are integer constants.

# DIVISION PROBLEM
Without using the division (/) devise a computer solution that can be used to m goes into n as well as the remainder. The values for m and n will be read as inputs.


# REVERSED FACTORIAL
Given a positive integer, N, devise a computer solution that can be used to find another integer M whose factorial is N. For example if N is given as 720 then M should be 6.


# BASE OF A NUMBER 
Given that a % b will give the remainder when a is divided by b, write a detailed computer solution that can be used to convert a number in base 10 to a different base. The inputs to your computer solution should be a number in base 10 and a base the number is to be converted to.
 
 # NUMBER OF DAYS 
Create a function that takes two dates and returns the number of days between the first and second date.For example, inputs of "June 10 2022" and "June 15 2020" ouputs 5 as the number of days between them.
