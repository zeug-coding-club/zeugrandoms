# THE COUNT OCCURRENCES PROBLEM
1. Write down a computer solution that can be used to count the number of times a particular digit appears in an (integer) input. Hint you may assume that there is an operator % that returns the remainder when one integer is divided by another and has the syntax a %b where a and b are integer constants.

# THE DIVISION PROBLEM
Without using the division (/) devise a computer solution that can be used to m goes into n as well as the remainder. The values for m and n will be read as inputs.
